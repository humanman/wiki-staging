# âœ¨ Astro DAO

### **Astro (SputnikDAO V2)**

[**Astro**](https://astrodao.com) builds on the foundations of SputnikDAO V1 and widely expands the functionality of DAOs built atop it.
Features shipped with Astro include:

* Flexible, role-based voting policies
* Stable coin payouts
  * This reduces the uncertainty imposed by crypto volatility between proposal requests and payouts
* Polling system for governance
* Electing representatives
* Cross-DAO accountability&#x20;
  * DAOs can serve as members of other DAOs
  * DAOs can own each other's social tokens for shared investment in collaboration.

Astro truly is the next evolution of SputnikDAO and comes with a host of new features, more flexibility, and a friendly UI.&#x20;

With Astro, DAOs will be able to retain more autonomy and, importantly, cast the net further in regards to governance through increased flexibility and the introduction of governance tokens.&#x20;

Despite the revamped user experience and broadened feature set, the goal of Astro remains the same; to empower communities within the NEAR ecosystem.

With Astro you can discover existing DAOs, [launch your own DAO](./how-to-launch-a-dao.md), and participate in [DAO governance](./dao-governance.md).
All you need is a NEAR account to start using Astro.
