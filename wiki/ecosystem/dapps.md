# dApps

Decentralized Applications (dApps) are applications developed for blockchains.
They combine smart contracts with a user-friendly frontend to make it easier to interact with smart contracts.
dApps are decentralized, so, typically, they aren't under the authority of a single authority.

There are a wide variety of dApps for different purposes including: gaming, social media, and finance among other categories.

To find dApps on NEAR, take a look at [Awesome NEAR](https://awesomenear.com/), a community owned resource that lists dApps available on NEAR.
