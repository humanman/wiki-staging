NEAR is primarily community centered, so the best way to contact somebody with knowledge about NEAR when you have questions or suggestions is within the NEAR community:

- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UY9Xf2k)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/cryptonear)
- [NEAR Forum](https://gov.near.org/)

Alternatively, if you need to contact somebody at NEAR Foundation and the community links above weren't helpful you drop us an [email](mailto:hello@near.foundation).

If you are encountering issues with your wallet, you can open a [support ticket here](https://nearhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).
